# Dynamic-Linked-List
This project implements a dynamically allocated linked list in MIPS32 assembly. The program supports inserting, deleting, and displaying integers in an ordered manner, ensuring the list remains sorted in ascending order. Memory allocation is handled using system call 9 (sbrk). The user interacts with the program through a menu-driven interface.


The program provides a menu-driven interface allowing users to:

    Insert a node in the correct position to maintain an ascending order.
    
    Delete a node while preserving the sorted order.
    
    Display the list in ascending order.
  
Key Features:

    Dynamic memory allocation with sbrk
  
    Efficient insertion and deletion maintaining a sorted list
    
    Modular implementation using subroutines for reusability
    
    Executable on SPIM simulator

  
This project was developed as part of the "Computer Systems Organization" course, fulfilling all specified requirements.
