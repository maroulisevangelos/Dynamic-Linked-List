# Dynamic-Linked-List
This project implements a dynamically allocated linked list in MIPS32 assembly. The program supports inserting, deleting, and displaying integers in an ordered manner, ensuring the list remains sorted in ascending order. Memory allocation is handled using system call 9 (sbrk). The user interacts with the program through a menu-driven interface.
